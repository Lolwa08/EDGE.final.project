# EDGE.final.project
Hello !
Welcome to Lolwa 's final Edge Python project .

What is it ?
Project name : 
Simplified Air traffic control system

Overview:
My project will be an air traffic control system that enables the air traffic controllers to track or guide the air planes in ground/air. They can see the location of the plane exactly, locate It to a runaway to departure or arrival. The number of runaways and planes dealt with / processed will be limited and not fully representative of real life for simplicity.
